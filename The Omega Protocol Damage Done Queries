# In this data, "target_name" represents the name of the target that is receiving an instance of damage dealt by the player. 
# Because of the way The Omega Protocol (Ultimate) is structured, the players are battling multiple versions of the enemy "Omega" so I'll be
# renaming some of those to make the results less confusing. To do this, I'll be using the "target_id" value which is different for each target regardless of the name of that target.
