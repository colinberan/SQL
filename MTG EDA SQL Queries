--I wrote this query because I had a great set of MTG card data, but unfortunately I didn't have any information on the release dates of each card, so I used a second set of data that contained the 
--release date of each card set and joined it on my original data set so I had a "releaseDate" column for every single card.

SELECT c.id, 
c.artist, 
c.colorIdentity, 
c.colors, 
c.manaValue,
c.flavorText, 
c.frameVersion, 
c.isOversized,
c.isPromo,
c.isOnlineOnly,
c.isFunny,
c.keywords, 
c.manaCost, 
c.name, 
c.power,
c.printings, 
c.rarity,
c.setCode, 
c.subtypes,
c.text, 
c.toughness, 
c.type, 
c.types, 
c.uuid,
s.releaseDate FROM `mtg-data-388201.cards.cards` AS c
LEFT JOIN `mtg-data-388201.cards.sets` AS s
ON c.setCode = s.code;
